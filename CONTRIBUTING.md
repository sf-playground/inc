### Collaborative Workflow for the Upstream Repository

#### git Branch Names

Contributors with write privileges on the upstream repository should use remote branches that include the author Github username, a hyphen-minus glyph (U+002D), and the working branch title like this:

```
githubuser-awesomethings
```

This naming scheme identifies you as the originator of the branch. Unless otherwise discussed and approved by the branch originator, please do not modify another originator's branch.

#### Source Review

Please use a pull request review process before merges to the master branch so that anyone with interest in commenting on your work has an opportunity to do so. If you are interested in a review of your work by one or more members of the team, please assign them as reviewers when you open your pull request.  You can request a review by selecting one or more Github usernames under the Reviewers heading to the right of the free text entry field for your pull request.  

#### Merges

All team members in this project have the authority to approve and merge a pull request to the master branch after an appropriate interval for review and commentary by any interested parties.

#### Maintenance

Branch originators are responsible for cleanup of their branches that are not intended to be long-lived working branches following the merge of commits to the master branch.
